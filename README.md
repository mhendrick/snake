Learning 6502 Assembly for the X16 Project

This is a learning project
The game Snake.

Assembled with ACME for the X16
acme -DMACHINE_C64=0 .\snake.asm 

Still needs a start screen
Controls are standard A(Left)W(Up)S(Down)D(Right) X(Exit) S(Start) from Green screen

I am pretty sure the apple placement will fail at some point to place the apple in viewable screen.
